			  <p>Welcome to Poetry Daily for iPhone! Poetry Daily is an anthology of contemporary poetry. Each day, we bring you a new poem from new books, magazines, and journals, chosen from the work of a wide variety of poets to provide you with a window on the broad range of poetry offered annually by publishers large and small.</p>
			  <p>When you open a poem, you can find more information about the poet and published source of the poem by clicking on the poem's title. To have better control of the text of a poem, click on the fullscreen icon in the upper right corner, where you can turn the iPhone to a landscape view and control the size of the text. (For long-lined poems, it can be challenging to replicate the design of the poet. For such poems, the smaller the text, the more true the poem is to the original line breaks.)</p>
			  <p>You can use Poetry Daily for iPhone to save your favorite poems. The "Favorites" tab will hold the poem on your iPhone until the poem is removed from our archive (where poems are stored a year from their featured date), giving you a chance to get to know the poem, or to have the poem in hand when you visit your local bookstore to find the poet's collection.</p>
			  <p>Check out Poetry Daily's Newsroom for daily updated news of poetry gathered from a variety of news sources around the web, and its Twitter feed for items of particular interest. </p>
			<p>If you would like to visit Poetry Daily's website to explore all the poems in the archive, click the "Visit Site" button above to view PD in Safari.</p>
